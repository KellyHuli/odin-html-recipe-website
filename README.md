# odin-recipes

This repository contains the recipes project from The Odin Project. This is part of the foundations part in which we explored html in combination with VS Code. So I learned how to use a boilerplate and what the different tags do on the page itself. I learned about elements, tags and nesting. I also know not how to make use of the <img> and the <a> tag and attributes. Lastly I learned about absolute and relative paths. All this should be visible in this repository.
