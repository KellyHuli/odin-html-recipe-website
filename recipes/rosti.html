    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Rösti is a Swiss dish consisting mainly of potatoes, in the style of a fritter. It was originally a breakfast dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but is now eaten all over Switzerland and around the world.</p>

    <p>In Swiss popular cultural ethos, rösti are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. Rösti dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin (Italy) culture. The geographic border separating the French- and German-speaking parts of the country is therefore commonly referred to as the <em>röstigraben</em>: literally the "rösti ditch". </p>
