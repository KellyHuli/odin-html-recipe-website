    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Tsukemono (漬物, literally "pickled things") are Japanese preserved vegetables usually pickled in salt. They are served with rice as an okazu (side dish), with drinks as an otsumami (snack), as an accompaniment to or garnish for meals.</p>

    <p>These Japanse pickles are also referred to as konomono (香の物), oshinko (御新香) or okōkō (御香々), all carrying the meaning of "fragrant dish" in Japanese. The ko or kō (香) portion in these names literally means "fragrant", and the term was used as a nyōbō kotoba or "woman's word" for miso in reference to the smell. </p>
